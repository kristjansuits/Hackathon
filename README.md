Brief overview of the data sets with the ending: qual
Seade (Device/Location): This column specifies the name or identifier of the device or location where the measurement is being taken (e.g., "Muuli VKM").
Mõõtmise aeg (Measurement time): This column records the timestamp of when the measurements were taken. The format is DD.MM.YYYY HH:MM (e.g., "01.03.2023 00:00").
Elektrijuhtivus (Conductivity): This column shows the water's electrical conductivity in microSiemens per centimeter (μS/cm). Conductivity is a measure of the water’s ability to conduct an electrical current, it is related to the concentration of ions in the water.
Hägusus (Turbidity): This column indicates the turbidity of the water, measured in Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU), which shows how cloudy or clear the water is. Parameter is often correlated with total suspended solids (TSS).
Hapnik (Oxygen): This column reports the dissolved oxygen content in the water in milligrams per liter (mg/L).
pH: This column measures the pH level of the water, indicating its acidity or alkalinity on a scale from 0 to 14, where 7 is neutral.
Laekumise aeg (Submission time): This column records the time when the data was logged or submitted, which might differ from the measurement time.

Brief overview of the data sets with the ending: quan
Seade (Device/Location): The device or location where the measurement is taken.
Mõõtmise aeg (Measurement time): The timestamp when the measurement was made.
Veetase (Water level): The water level measured in meters.
Vooluhulk (Flow rate): The flow rate or water discharge measured in cubic meters per hour (m³/h).
Voolukiirus (Flow velocity): The flow velocity.
Laekumise aeg (Submission time): The timestamp when the data was submitted.

Information on the sensors used for both quality and quantity measurements may be found in the folder "Measurement-device-specs"
